Thank you for considering contributing to polars_dart!

There are a few areas where you can help contribute code and/or documentation:

### Documentation website

You can directly contribute to website pages you are seeing right now,
or help with improving `dartdoc_astro` which is the program/plugin used to generate
code documentation in lieu of `dart doc`.

### Library code

You can also contribute directly to polars_dart by writing PRs to add new classes and
methods, or by contributing to flutter_rust_bridge to enable new usage patterns for polars_dart.
